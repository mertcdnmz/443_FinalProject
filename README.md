In this final project for CENG443 Heterogeneus Parallel Programming lecture, we are thinking of implementation for accelerating Gaussian Jordan Elimination Method with big matrices. 

In this project there will be 3 different versions of the implementation of Gaussian Jordan Elimination Method; 

* The first version will be the serial CPU program, 
* The second version will be naive version of accelerated parallel GPU program
* The third version will be optimized version of accelerated parallel GPU program.  

We will run program with different matrix sizes and then we will compare execution time for different versions.
